/*
It is possible to bypass the blockage put in place by the Arduino IDE so that a setup file can be included
by a sketch.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Find the folder containing the boards.txt file for the processor board package you are using. To do this
   click the IDE menu "File->Preferences". At the bottom of that window click the link to the preferences.txt
   file. This will open a folder. Navigate to find the folder containing the "boards.txt" file for the
   processor you are using. Example paths for RP2040 and ESP32 are:

   C:\Users\xxxxx\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\rp2040\hardware\rp2040\2.5.2
   C:\Users\xxxxx\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\esp32\hardware\esp32\2.0.4

2.  Copy the platform.local.txt file to that folder. A copy of the "platform.local.txt" is in this sketch
    folder, press Ctrl+K to open the folder.

3.  Close the Arduino IDE and open it again so the added file is recognised.

To Do:
